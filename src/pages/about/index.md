# Music

My name is Thomas Power. I'm a composer and creative developer from the most westerly town in Ireland, Dingle. Growing up in such a place has profoundly effected my life and music. Dark cloudy skies and days of endless rain are the inspiration for all of the music you can find here.

I write guitar driven atmospheric rock music as [Wild Surmise](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Bp6VKHxaWKD4fE7kZzSLN)

I write piano driven experimental and electronic music as [L'Homme Moyen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6fSktQPfbhoRyhAs5RzVF8)

And I compose music for media and live performance with the name that my parents gave me.
